# Arren_BG1

This is an alpha version! It is not even content-complete. It has not been at all tested beyond "WeiDU does not actively loathe its existence." This is released purely as a milestone for the BGCCC: install at your own risk.

It is still missing:
1. Most of the planned talks
2. Most banters
3. Interjections
4. Several mini-quests
5. (very, very eventually) a custom kit
6. A pseudo-romance for a female PC of any race
7. A soundset
8. A less terrible portrait

Currently it features:
1. A small recruitment quest
2. Five whole talks with the PC!
3. Banters with ten entire NPCs!
4. Some incredibly half-assed custom items!

So, warnings aside, what is this mod?

Arren is an elven shaman possessed of a grave responsibility and an incredibly bad attitude. Loudly indifferent to the concerns of mortals, she's worked for some years as what she terms a "consulting medium," speaking with ghosts to help them move on from this plane - and, occasionally, tracking down missing people. The bandit crisis has her looking for the missing son of a wealthy family.

You may find that there are certain traits of this character that seem familiar. The author can neither confirm nor deny, but speculating about this is funny and therefore encouraged.
